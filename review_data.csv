I haven't used this for Heavy Task except gaming and the Games runs smoothly, I have noticed the game getting stuck only 2-3 times . Battery capacity is not that good , you have to charge every now and then but hey this is a Gaming Laptop so don't expect much . Also the duration depends on the type of task . But an average is 3-4 hours of battery life once its fully charged (Till 90-95%) . I would suggest everyone to go for this . With his laptop, purchase a Keyboard cover and a Laptop stand .
