This variant is best among all other budget gaming laptops from other companies (Lenovo - LOQ, Asus - Tuf Gaming, Dell - G15 series , Acer - Nitro V Gaming) because almost all laptop has same specs except this has 4050 series of GPU. And I have been using this for a month . Everything seems good and smooth . I haven't used this for Heavy Task except gaming and the Games runs smoothly, I have noticed the game getting stuck only 2-3 times . Battery capacity is not that good , you have to charge every now and then but hey this is a Gaming Laptop so don't expect much . Also the duration depends on the type of task . But an average is 3-4 hours of battery life once its fully charged (Till 90-95%) . I would suggest everyone to go for this . With his laptop, purchase a Keyboard cover and a Laptop stand . The Fan Sound is loud . And the negatives are - It has 4050 series GPU with 75W TGP ( A good GPU should have 90W TGP) and the CPU is i5 13th Gen but At this price it worth with all these features."
